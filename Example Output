 Limitations

- The model is simplistic and relies solely on sentiment for prediction.
- Small datasets may lead to inaccurate predictions.
- Sentiment does not always correlate with stock price movements.

 Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional features (e.g., trading volume, technical indicators).
- Expand the model to handle multiple stock tickers.
- Enhance sentiment analysis with contextual embedding models (e.g., BERT).
